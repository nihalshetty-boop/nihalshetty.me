Tips
Always prefix commits with feat:, fix:, etc., for versioning to work.

Use default_bump: patch in your GitHub Action if unsure or inconsistent.

Use BREAKING CHANGE: only when your update would break previous functionality or contracts.

## Breaking Changes Example

To trigger a **major version bump**, include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit body:

```bash
git commit -m "refactor: switch auth flow

BREAKING CHANGE: auth endpoint now uses JWT"
